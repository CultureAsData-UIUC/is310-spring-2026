## Advanced Text Analysis Exploration

Now that you are starting to learn the basics of text analysis, you can start to explore more advanced techniques that you might want to use in your final project. Today I will be sharing code to help you get started with some information extraction, using Named Entity Recognition (NER), and information retrieval, using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). These methods are just some of the possible ones you might want to use, and I list additional options below.

### Cleaning Project Gutenberg Texts

Before we can start trying them out though, one issue we haven't addressed is the fact that each Project Gutenberg book has a header and footer that we might want to remove before we start our analysis. This is a common issue with text data, and it is often called "noise" in the data. We could use regular expressions to remove this data, but there's also existing Python libraries for working with Project Gutenberg data. In particular, the `gutenbergpy` library has functionality to remove that metadata. You can find information about the library here [https://github.com/raduangelescu/gutenbergpy](https://github.com/raduangelescu/gutenbergpy) and install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install gutenbergpy
```

This library has a set of text markers that it uses to remove the headers and footers that you can see here [https://github.com/raduangelescu/gutenbergpy/blob/master/gutenbergpy/textget.py#L23](https://github.com/raduangelescu/gutenbergpy/blob/master/gutenbergpy/textget.py#L23) and in this figure:

![](../../assets/images/gutenbergpy_markers.png)

To use the library, you can use the following code:

```python
import gutenbergpy.textget

def clean_book(url):
	# This gets a book by its gutenberg id number
	if pd.notna(url):
		pg_id = url.split('/pg')[-1].split('.')[0]
		try:
			raw_book = gutenbergpy.textget.get_text_by_id(pg_id) # with headers
			clean_book = gutenbergpy.textget.strip_headers(raw_book) # without headers
			return clean_book
		except Exception as e:
			print(f"Error getting book: {e} with id: {pg_id} and url: {url}")
			return None

tqdm.pandas(desc="Cleaning Books")
combined_novels_nyt_df['cleaned_pg_eng_text'] = combined_novels_nyt_df.progress_apply(clean_book, axis=1)
```

This code will get the text of the book by its Project Gutenberg ID, which we are deriving from the Gutenberg URL, and then remove the headers and footers. Such a step is necessary since otherwise the headers and footers would be included in our text analysis, which would skew our results.

### Information Extraction Methods

Now that we have our cleaned data, we can start to explore some information extraction methods. We cannot cover them all in this course but I wanted to share some common approaches and Python Libraries that you might want to explore further.

*Methods for textual data:*

- **Part of Speech Tagging**: This is a technique that assigns parts of speech to each word in a sentence. For example, it might tag a word as a noun, verb, adjective, etc. This can be useful for identifying the grammatical structure of a sentence.
- **Dependency Parsing**: This is a technique that assigns syntactic structure to a sentence. For example, it might identify the subject, object, and verb in a sentence. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between words in a sentence.
- **Coreference Resolution**: This is a technique that identifies when two or more words in a sentence refer to the same entity. For example, it might identify that "he" and "John" refer to the same person. This can be useful for understanding the relationships between entities in a text.

*Popular Python libraries for these tasks include:*

- **spaCy library** [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/): spaCy is a popular Python library for NLP that provides a wide range of tools for information extraction, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part of Speech Tagging, Dependency Parsing, and Coreference Resolution. spaCy is known for its powerful architecture and multiple models for different languages. Here's an example of a dependency parse tree from spaCy:

*Methods for image or video data:*

- **Object Detection**: This is a technique that identifies objects in an image or video. For example, it might identify a person, car, or tree in an image. This can be useful for understanding the content of an image or video, and in many ways is similar to NER, which we will explore more in-depth below.
- **Facial Recognition**: This technique is a subset of Object Detection that identifies faces in an image or video. For example, it might identify a person's face in an image. It is usually discussed as a separate category from Object Detection because it is a specialized form of Object Detection, and because of the deeply problematic ethical implications of facial recognition technology.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: We have discussed this technique in-depth, but never as an information extraction technique, even though that is technically what it is doing, as we can see in this figure:

- **Edge Detection**: This is a technique that identifies edges in an image or video. For example, it might identify the edges of a person, car, or tree in an image. This can be useful for understanding the content of an image or video, and for tasks like image classification and object detection.
- **Image Segmentation**: This is a technique that identifies regions in an image or video. It is similar to object detection, but it identifies regions instead of objects. This can be useful for understanding the content of an image or video, and for tasks like image classification and object detection.

#### Named Entity Recognition (NER) & SpaCy

What is Named Entity Recognition?

From the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition):

> “Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.”

What does this look like in practice? Let's look at a few examples.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*zDbB-LV-Dlm_F_PX)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*w4449DJGuXlay02gFt8APg.png)

We can see that in these images, parts of the text are being highlighted and classified as different categories (or **entities** if you will). Many of these examples might seem straightforward, but how do we decide what is an entity exactly? And how did NER become a defined field instead of just being part of text mining?

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Uf_qQ0zF8G8y9zUhndA08w.png)

This graph represents a common typology of NLP tasks, comparing it to Natural Language Understanding and Automatic Speech Recognition.

While technically correct, I find this graph confusing 🤔. The exact definition of NER’s boundaries relative to other nlp/nlu tasks is very porous. For example, in addition to recognizing entities, NER can also include parts of text classification, entity disambiguation, relationship extraction all parts of NER (though they are separated in this chart).

*So if this is so porous how did NER first develop?*

![](../../assets/images/ner_history.png)

From this Wiki page, we can see that the concept of “named entity” first developed at the Message Understanding Conference-6 in 1995. Here’s an example template given to participants from MUC-3 and you can even read the original MUC manual here <https://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_projects/muc/muc_sw/muc_sw_manual.html>:

![](../../assets/images/muc_example.png)

The big takeaway is that NER is relatively new. The field really takes off as a field with Text Analysis Conferences beginning in 2009 <https://tac.nist.gov/> and it is also relatively recent in digital humanities.

The first DH conference presentation listing NER as a topic was in 2004:

![](../../assets/images/dh_ner_conference.png)

### Information Retrieval Methods

Now that we are seeing how information extraction can help us augment and understand our textual data, we can start to explore information retrieval methods. It is important to note that the line between information extraction and retrieval can be blurry, but in general, information extraction is about extracting structured information from unstructured text, while information retrieval is about retrieving relevant information from a collection of documents.

*Methods for textual data:*

- **Topic Modeling** is a technique that identifies topics in a corpus of text data. Topic modeling works by identifying groups of words that frequently appear together in the corpus and assigning them to topics. Each topic is a group of words that are related to each other, and each document in the corpus is assigned a distribution over the topics. There are many different implementations of topic modeling, including *Latent Semantic Allocation* (LSA), *Latent Dirichlet Allocation* (LDA), and *Non-negative Matrix Factorization* (NMF).

![](https://yosinski.com/mlss12/media/slides/MLSS-2012-Blei-Probabilistic-Topic-Models_020.png)

- **Word Embeddings** is a technique that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Word embeddings are useful for capturing the semantic relationships between words in a corpus of text data. There are many different implementations of word embeddings, including *Word2Vec*, *GloVe*, and *FastText*.
- **Contextual Embeddings** is a technique that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, taking into account the context in which the words appear. Contextual embeddings are useful for capturing the semantic relationships between words in a corpus of text data. There are many different implementations of contextual embeddings, including *BERT*, *GPT-2*, and *XLNet*.
- **Document Similarity & Ranking** is a suite of techniques including *Cosine Similarity*, *Jaccard Similarity*, and *BM25* that are used to measure the similarity between documents in a corpus of text data. Document similarity and ranking are useful for identifying similar documents in a corpus and for ranking documents based on their relevance to a query.

*Popular Python libraries for these tasks include:*

- **Gensim** [https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/): Gensim is a popular Python library for topic modeling and word embeddings. Gensim provides a wide range of tools for analyzing text data, including LDA, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec.
- **FastText** [https://fasttext.cc/](https://fasttext.cc/): FastText is a popular Python library for word embeddings. FastText provides a wide range of tools for analyzing text data, including word embeddings and text classification.
- **BERT** [https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html): BERT is a popular Python library for contextual embeddings. BERT provides a wide range of tools for analyzing text data, including contextual embeddings and text classification.
- **Scikit-Learn** [https://scikit-learn.org/](https://scikit-learn.org/): Scikit-Learn is a popular Python library for document similarity and ranking. Scikit-Learn provides a wide range of tools for analyzing text data, including cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and BM25.
- **Transformers** [https://huggingface.co/transformers/](https://huggingface.co/transformers/): Transformers is a popular Python library for contextual embeddings. Transformers provides a wide range of tools for analyzing text data, including BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet.

*Methods for image or video data*:

- **Image Classification** is a technique that assigns labels to images based on their content. For example, it might classify an image as a cat, dog, or car. Image classification is useful for understanding the content of images and for tasks like object detection and image segmentation.
- **Image Clustering** is a technique that groups similar images together based on their content. For example, it might group images of cats together and images of dogs together. Image clustering is useful for organizing large collections of images and for tasks like image retrieval and image recommendation.
- **Image Similarity & Ranking** is a suite of techniques including *Cosine Similarity*, *Jaccard Similarity*, and *Euclidean Distance* that are used to measure the similarity between images. Image similarity and ranking are useful for identifying similar images in a collection and for ranking images based on their relevance to a query.

*Popular Python libraries for these tasks include:*

- Many of the same libraries used for textual data analysis can also be used for image and video data analysis, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Image. These libraries provide a wide range of tools for analyzing image and video data, including object detection, facial recognition, and image segmentation.

### TF-IDF & Scikit-Learn

`Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency` or TF-IDF  was first proposed in a 1972 paper by Karen Spärck Jones under the name “term specificity” and was later named TF-IDF by Steve Robertson in 1976. The algorithm is used to determine the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. The algorithm is based on the idea that a word is important if it appears frequently in a document, but infrequently in the rest of the documents in the collection.

::: {.callout-note}
⚡️ Great resources for learning more about TF-IDF are: <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/analyzing-documents-with-tfidf"> Matthew J. Lavin, "Analyzing Documents with TF-IDF," <i>Programming Historian</i> 8 (2019)</a> and <a href="https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/01-TF-IDF.html" >Melanie Walsh's Textbook</a>
:::

The reason TF-IDF is so popular is because it is intended to surface terms that are distinctive across as set of documents (or a **corpus**). Often times with word counting you get lots of high frequency words (remember Zipf's law) but these words aren't always helpful if you are trying to understand the concepts within the text. High frequency words are more useful for author attribution.

So the way TF-IDF works is the following operations as visualized in this diagram:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*qQgnyPLDIkUmeZKN2_ZWbQ.png)

To break this down into code it really looks like the following:

```python
term_frequency = number of times a given term appears in document

inverse_document_frequency = log(total number of documents / number of documents with term) + 1*****

tf-idf = term_frequency * inverse_document_frequency
```

### Advanced Computational Methods

In addition to information extraction and retrieval, general modeling techniques allow us to explore and classify patterns in data. These methods are widely applicable across text, image, and network data, providing diverse ways to interpret and model cultural information.

**Network Analysis**

Network analysis examines relationships between entities, such as characters in novels, authors and their works, or people and organizations in historical documents. By representing entities as nodes and relationships as edges, network analysis allows us to model complex interactions.

- **Graph Creation**: Network models can be constructed using libraries like NetworkX or iGraph for Python. These libraries allow for flexible creation of graphs, from basic connections to complex, weighted, or directed graphs.
- **Centrality Measures**: Metrics like degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality help identify influential nodes in a network. For example, in a network of historical figures, centrality measures might reveal key connectors or influencers within cultural or social movements.
- **Community Detectio**n: Techniques like modularity-based clustering and Louvain algorithm identify sub-groups or communities within a network. Community detection can be valuable in studying thematic clusters or social groups in cultural datasets.
- **Visualization**: Network visualizations can reveal patterns that are hard to identify in raw data. Gephi, Cytoscape, and PyVis are popular tools for visually exploring networks.

**Classification Models**

Classification models can assign labels to data based on learned patterns. These models are particularly useful for categorizing documents, images, or entities into predefined categories.

- **Random Forests**: A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It’s known for robustness and interpretability and can be used for tasks like author classification, genre prediction, or sentiment analysis. Random forests aggregate predictions from multiple trees, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: SVMs are effective for high-dimensional text classification tasks, such as categorizing articles into topics. SVMs work by finding a hyperplane that best separates classes, making them particularly useful for binary classification tasks.
- **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression, despite its name, is a classification method. It’s simpler than other models but often surprisingly effective, especially when interpretability is essential. It’s commonly used in social science and humanities research for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: When working with large datasets or complex data (like images or text embeddings), neural networks offer powerful modeling options. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image classification, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers (e.g., BERT) are common for text classification and sequence prediction tasks.

**Clustering Techniques**

Clustering methods group similar data points, allowing us to explore underlying structures or themes without predefined categories. These methods are useful for exploratory data analysis in unsupervised learning contexts.

- **K-Means Clustering**: This is a popular clustering technique that partitions data into a predetermined number of clusters. In cultural datasets, k-means can group documents with similar themes or identify similar objects in image datasets.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Hierarchical clustering creates a dendrogram representing nested groupings within the data. This technique is valuable for visualizing how data points relate hierarchically, which can be insightful when studying genre similarities or character connections.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**: Unlike k-means, which assigns each data point to a single cluster, GMMs can model data as a mixture of multiple distributions. This flexibility is useful when dealing with overlapping cultural themes or nuanced data patterns.

**Dimensionality Reduction**

Dimensionality reduction techniques simplify data, making it easier to visualize and analyze high-dimensional datasets like word embeddings or image features.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA reduces dimensionality by transforming data into principal components that explain the most variance. It is often used to preprocess data for clustering or classification and can also help visualize word embeddings.
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: t-SNE is especially useful for visualizing high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a 2D or 3D plane. It’s commonly used to visualize clusters in embeddings from text or image data.

**Time Series & Forecasting Analysis**

When working with temporal data, such as publication dates or historical events, time series analysis can reveal trends and patterns over time.

- **Trend Analysis**: Techniques like moving averages and decomposition can help identify trends and seasonality in cultural datasets. For example, examining word usage trends over time can offer insights into shifting themes or sentiment.
- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: ARIMA models can forecast future trends based on past values. This is useful in historical studies or predicting trends in cultural data, such as publication or social media trends.

**Tools and Libraries**

For implementing these techniques, consider these widely used libraries:

- Scikit-Learn: Provides accessible implementations for classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-Learn is a versatile tool for general modeling tasks and supports a range of classifiers like Random Forests, SVMs, and k-means.
- Statsmodels: Ideal for statistical modeling, including time series analysis.
- TensorFlow and PyTorch: Powerful libraries for building neural networks and deep learning models, especially for tasks involving large, complex datasets.
- NetworkX and Gephi: Useful for network analysis, providing tools for constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex networks.

Each of these libraries has its own history, and some of what they provide overlaps. Here's a helpful chart outlining some of their pros and cons.

![](https://activewizards.com/content/blog/Comparison_of_Python_NLP_libraries/nlp-librares-python-prs-and-cons01.png)

Ultimately, which library you choose to use depends on what you want to do with your data, but there's some general principles for text analysis that you should consider regardless of method.

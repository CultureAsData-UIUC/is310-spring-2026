⚡️ This lesson has been adapted from Melanie Walsh's chapter on Web Scraping in <i>Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python</i> textbook <a href="https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/02-Web-Scraping-Part1.html">https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/02-Web-Scraping-Part1.html</a>. Many thanks to Melanie for sharing their materials!

Now that we have learned how to work with Python modules and read and write files, we can start to think about how to get data from the web. This is a very important skill for a digital humanist, as many of the sources we might want to work with are online.

## What Is Web Scraping and Why Is It Useful?

![A diagram of web scraping.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d9b2749f8dce3ebe4e676d/1566319595811-MFGFIVQGNNSY2W4TZ4AV/web-scraping.png?format=1500w)

So far when it comes to working with the web, you have been creating your own HTML pages and hosting them via GitHub. But we can also use Python to interact with the web in a different way: by scraping data from web pages. The data we extract is exactly the same as what you have been writing, so elements like headers, paragraphs, and links, etc.

Web scraping can be incredibly useful considering how much data is available on the web and how little of it is often put into tabular format. For example, you might want to scrape a web archive to get data for a research project, or you might want to scrape a social media site to get access to data that isn't available through their API. 

Web scraping is also what we use to preserve the web. Remember the Wayback Machine? That's a web archive that uses web scraping to save web pages. The way it works is that it uses a web crawler to find links to web pages and then it uses web scraping to save the content of those pages.

![A screenshot of SUCHO.](../../assets/images/sucho.png)

This method has also been used by scholars to do community-driven data preservation. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, a group of scholars and librarians founded the *Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online* (SUCHO) group and used web scraping to preserve the content of Ukrainian websites [https://www.sucho.org/](https://www.sucho.org/). This was important because if servers are bombed, the content of those websites would be lost forever.

### Is Web Scraping Legal or Ethical?

Technically, most publicly available internet data is considered legal to collect, even if it's not explicitly licensed. In 2019, "the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that automated scraping of publicly accessible data likely does not violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[^1] However, there are some important caveats to this. For example, this ruling only applies to US based websites and the laws in other countries might be different. One of the more recent and important European developments was the passing of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, which has implications for web scraping. In particular, the GDPR bans the scraping of emails and personal names from websites. More recently, a consortium of regulators from multiple countries released a joint statement warning social media companies that they must protect user data from scraping.[^2]

In terms of ethics, web scraping can be a bit of a grey area. It's generally considered ethical to scrape publicly available data, but it's not ethical to scrape data from a website that has a terms of service that prohibits scraping. It can be difficult to find those terms of service, but one more obvious example of a website banning scraping is if it prohibits scraping in its `robots.txt` file. A robots.txt file is a file that websites use to tell web crawlers which pages they are allowed to scrape.


![A screenshot of the New York Times robots.txt file.](../../assets/images/robots.png)

For example,the above image is of the robots.txt file for the New York Times website is [https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt](https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt). We can see that it lists a number of pages that are not allowed to be scraped (those are the ones with the `Disallow` directive). You might also come across `robots.txt` files that have a `Crawl-delay` directive, which tells web crawlers how long to wait between requests. The reason this is important is that if you try to web scrape a website that has a `robots.txt` file that prohibits scraping, you could be banned from the website. This is because the website might think you are a web crawler and not a human, and it might block your IP address.

What to collect and how to collect it is a big part of the ethics of web scraping. Melanie Walsh has a great overview of some of these tradeoffs:

> Just because something is legal or gets approved by an IRB does not mean it is ethical. Collecting, sharing, and publishing internet data created by or about individuals can lead to unwanted public scrutiny, harm, and other negative consequences for those individuals. For these reasons, some researchers attempt to anonymize internet data before sharing it or before publishing an article that cites a post specifically. Yet anonymizing internet data also does not give credit to internet users as creators and authors.

> There is no single, simple answer to the many difficult questions raised by internet data collection. It is important to develop an ethical framework that responds to the specifics of your particular research project or use case (e.g., the platform, the people involved, the context, the potential consequences, etc.).

> In my own research, I have started seeking explicit permission from internet users when I want to quote them in a published article. In this book, I only share internet data that meets a certain threshold of publicness, such as tweets from verified Twitter accounts or Reddit posts with a certain number of upvotes. This is an approach that I have developed based on some of the models and readings included below.

IRB refers to the Institutional Review Board, which is a committee that reviews and approves research involving human subjects at universities, and most of the time, web scraping or accessing digital data is considered not to be human subjects research. However, even if we don't need IRB approval, it's still important to think about the ethics of web scraping and to consider the potential consequences of our actions. I personally think Walsh's approach is a good one: to think about the specifics of your research project and to develop both a legal *and* an ethical framework that responds to those specifics. And also to think about the consent of the people whose data you are collecting. There's no one size fits all answer, but we should always think about not only if we can collect data, but also if we should and how we should.

![A screenshot from Walsh chapter.](../../assets/images/walsh_web_scraping.png)

As you can see above, Walsh also has a great overview of different strategies and resources for this type of work, so highly recommend visiting the original chapter to explore these further in depth [https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/01-User-Ethics-Legal-Concerns.html](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/01-User-Ethics-Legal-Concerns.html).

## Web Scraping with Python

Now that we have a sense of web scraping generally, it's time to try it out in Python. We will be using two Python libraries to do this: `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`. The `requests` library is a library that allows us to send HTTP requests to web pages. The `beautifulsoup4` library is a library that allows us to parse HTML and XML documents. We will be using `requests` to get the web page and `beautifulsoup4` to parse the web page.

### Installing Required Packages

The first step is to install our required packages into our virtual environment. If you have yet to set up a virtual environment, you can follow the instructions in the [previous lesson](../creating-curating-humanities-data/04-virtual-environments).

If you have already created your virtual environment, then you can either activate it using Visual Studio Code or by using the terminal. If you are using the terminal, you can activate your virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Notice here we are installing two packages: `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` in a single line. **You can install as many packages as you want in a single `pip install` command, just separate them with a space.**

----

We previously discussed Python libraries when we talked about classes and virtual environments, but let's dig in a bit deeper.

**Library**

- There's a lot of different definitions for this term, but most generally you can think of this as a collection of software that's directly used by other software. Most often, this will be a generalizable piece of logic that is useful to bundle separately so that other, unrelated pieces of software can use it. Because it's an informal term in Python and not a specific, technical one, it's more useful to think about libraries in terms of how code is organized. Used in this way, the concept of "software libraries" spans many different programing languages and development contexts: we have Python libraries, C++ libraries, Javascript libraries, operating system libraries, etc.
- Let's consider libraries that we've used. The [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is the most obvious example which encompasses many different purposes and packages (more on that later), but is unified in that it is included in all Python installations so that Python code that's written using the Standard Library will run on any compatible Python environment of the expected version. Parts of the Standard Library that we've used before include packages like [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).
- There are also third-party libraries that people build in Python, which can be found on The Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>. These are usually less expansive than the Standard Library, but can be useful because they are written for specialized tasks. This week, we'll take a look at [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), which is analogous in scope to packages like pathlib. In fact, third party libraries are often organized into a single package. A library like Beautiful Soup can best be thought of in terms of purpose: you want to accomplish the a particular, common task like scraping a website and Beautiful Soup helps accomplish it.

**Package** 

- A package is a formal term in the Python context. It's a specific organization of code which all lives in a single directory. Libraries sometimes (often) consist of a single package (e.g. PathLib or BS4), so the term is sometimes (often) used interchangeably. Packages are the basic unit by which we install and use libraries. So when we type `pip install beautifulsoup4` into the terminal, we're installing the `beautifulsoup4` package.

This is very detailed, but just remember that while these terms are often used interchangeably, a package is a more specific concept referring to the structure and distribution of code, whereas a library is a broader concept referring to reusable code functionality.

Finally, you'll see that I often use `pip` or `pip3` when installing packages. This is because `pip` is the package installer for Python and `pip3` is the package installer for Python 3. If you're using Python 3, you can use either `pip` or `pip3`, but if you're using Python 2, you should use `pip2`. So generally, you'll want to use `pip` to install packages but to double check you're installing packages for the right version of Python, you can check the version of Python you're using by running `python --version` and then use the corresponding `pip` command.

---- 

Now we can starting using these packages in our Python code. First, we need to create a new folder in our `is310-coding-assignments` called `web_scraping` and then create a new file called `first_web_scraping.py`. Then we can add the following code to our file:

```python
import beautifulsoup4
```

You'll likely see the following error if you try to run this code:

![A screenshot of the error when trying to import beautifulsoup4.](../../assets/images/beautifulsoup_error.png)

That is because `beautifulsoup4` is not a package that we can import directly. Instead, we need to import the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` package. This difference is a bit confusing since the name of the package on PyPI (`beautifulsoup4`) doesn't match the actual Python code package (`bs4`).

But this is a great example of why we always want to read the documentation, which is available here [https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

![A screenshot of the BeautifulSoup documentation.](../../assets/images/beautifulsoup_documentation.png)

If we click on the `Quick Start` link, we can see that the documentation tells us to import the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` package. So we can update our code to look like this:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Remember that the `from` keyword is used to import a specific module (aka Class or function in Python) from a package. Alternatively we could also import the entire package and then use the `BeautifulSoup` class like this:

```python
import bs4
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
```

Finally we could technically use the asterisk symbol, which often means "all" or "any", to import all the modules (aka Classes and functions) in the package:

```python
from bs4 import *
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
# imports * imports all modules in a package
```

However, this is generally not recommended because it can make it difficult to understand where a particular module is coming from.

You may also need to install a parser for `BeautifulSoup`. The `html.parser` parser is included with Python, but you can also use the `lxml` parser, which is faster and more lenient. You can install the `lxml` parser by running the following command:

```bash
pip install lxml
```

There's actually a number of possible parsers you can use with `BeautifulSoup`. Here's a quick overview of the different parsers you can use with `BeautifulSoup` from the library's documentation:

| Parser                     | Typical usage                                | Advantages                                                                 | Disadvantages                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Python’s `html.parser`     | `BeautifulSoup(markup, "html.parser")`       | Batteries included<br>Decent speed<br>Lenient (As of Python 2.7.3 and 3.2)| Not as fast as lxml<br>Less lenient than html5lib  |
| lxml’s HTML parser         | `BeautifulSoup(markup, "lxml")`              | Very fast<br>Lenient                                                      | External C dependency                              |
| lxml’s XML parser          | `BeautifulSoup(markup, "lxml-xml")`<br>`BeautifulSoup(markup, "xml")` | Very fast<br>The only currently supported XML parser                      | External C dependency                              |
| html5lib                   | `BeautifulSoup(markup, "html5lib")`          | Extremely lenient<br>Parses pages the same way a web browser does<br>Creates valid HTML5 | Very slow<br>External Python dependency            |

I usually just use the built-in `html.parser` parser, but you can use the `lxml` parser if you want to. Next we'll learn what these parsers are doing and how to use them!

### Beautiful Soup Basics

In the `Quick Start` guide [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start), we have an example of how to use the `BeautifulSoup` class to parse an HTML document. Let's try this example in our `first_web_scraping.py` file.

```python
html_doc = """
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')

print(soup.prettify())
```

We can see that `html_doc` is a variable that holds a multiline string that contains HTML. We are then using the `BeautifulSoup` class to parse the HTML document and the `prettify()` method to print the HTML document in a more readable format.

The power of `BeautifulSoup` is that it let's us use the structure of the HTML document to extract the data we want. For example, we can use the built-in `find_all()` method to get all the links in the document and then use the `get_text()` method to get the text of each link.

```python
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
	print(link.get('href'))
	print(link.get_text())
```

From this we can see that we are getting all the links in the document and then printing the `href` attribute of each link and the text of each link. This is a very simple example, but it shows how we can use the structure of the HTML document to extract the data we want.

In `BeautifulSoup`, we have four kinds of objects that we can work with: `Tag`, `NavigableString`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Comment`. The `Tag` object is the most important object and represents an HTML or XML tag. The `NavigableString` object represents the text within a tag. The `BeautifulSoup` object represents the whole of the document. The `Comment` object represents an HTML or XML comment. We'll just focus on the `Tag` and `BeautifulSoup` objects for now.

**BeautifulSoup Class**

We've already started to use `BeautifulSoup` class, but let's take a closer look at it. The `BeautifulSoup` class is the main class in the `BeautifulSoup` library and represents the whole of the document.

We usually define a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing in the HTML document and the parser we want to use. You'll notice that the variable containing the `BeautifulSoup` object is often called `soup`, but you can call it whatever you want.

The core power of `BeautifulSoup` is that it let's you navigate the HTML Document like a tree, which you can read more about here [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#navigating-the-tree](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#navigating-the-tree).

Remember in HTML we can have nested HTML elements, and so `BeautifulSoup` let's us use that structure to find elements. Otherwise, this would just be **unstructured text** which is difficult to work with.

So far to navigate the tree we've been using the `find_all` method, which has the following documentation [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#find-all](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#find-all).

![A screenshot of the find_all method documentation.](../../assets/images/bs4_find_all.png)

In the documentation, it talks about how this method "looks through a tag’s descendants and retrieves all descendants that match your filters." This is a bit confusing, but what it means is that the `find_all` method searches through the HTML document and retrieves all the elements that match the filter you give it. 

So to go back to our previous example:

```python
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
	print(link.get('href'))
	print(link.get_text())
```

Here we are passing in the `a` tag name to the `find_all` method. We could also pass in other filters like a class name:

```python
links = soup.find_all('a', class_='sister')
```

Now this code should pretty identically because we only have links with the class name `sister`. However, you can imagine how this could be useful if you only wanted to get links with a specific class name.

You can also pass in other filters like `id`, `href`, etc. For example, if you wanted to get the link with the `id` attribute `link1`, you could do this:

```python
link = soup.find_all('a', id='link1')
```

The filter can be a tag name, a tag attribute, a tag attribute value, a tag class, a tag id, etc. The `find_all` method returns a list of tags that match the filter.

**Tag Class**

So far we have been just searching the HTML tree to find elements, but it is helpful to understand that in `BeautifulSoup` each element is represented by a `Tag` object. The `Tag` object is the most important object in `BeautifulSoup` and represents an HTML or XML tag.

For example, in our existing code we could use the `find_all()` method to get all the `p` tags in the document and then use the `get_text()` method to get the text of each `p` tag.

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
	print(paragraph.get_text())
```

Tags are equivalent to the elements in HTML, so any time you want to see if tag exists in the HTML document, you can use either the `find_all()` method to search for it or simply `soup.p` to get the first `p` tag in the document.

We can also use the `.name` attribute to get the name of the tag and the `.attrs` attribute to get the attributes of the tag.

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
	print(paragraph.name)
	print(paragraph.attrs)
```

Now we should see the name of the tag and the attributes of the tag printed for each `p` tag in the document.

Attributes are equivalent to the attributes in HTML, so any time you want to see if an attribute exists in the HTML document, you can use either the `.get()` method to get the value of the attribute or simply square brackets to get the value of the attribute.

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
	print(paragraph.get('class'))
	print(paragraph['class'])
```

Now that we are understanding how `BeautifulSoup` represents HTML, we can start to further navigate the HTML tree. In addition to searching for elements, we can also navigate the tree by moving up, down, and sideways. We can use the `parent`, `children`, `descendants`, `next_sibling`, and `previous_sibling` attributes to navigate the tree. So for example in our basic HTML doc variable we have paragraphs that are siblings, so we can use the `next_sibling` attribute to get the next sibling of a tag.

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
	print(paragraph.next_sibling)
```

We could also use the `parent` attribute to get the parent of a tag.

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
	print(paragraph.parent)
```

You don't need to memorize every functionality in `BeautifulSoup`, but it's good to know that it's there and to know how to look up the documentation. The documentation has lots of examples, so it's a great resource to use when you're working with `BeautifulSoup`.

### Scraping Project Gutenberg

So far we've been using some fairly basic HTML but we can start working with an actual HTML document. Today we'll be using *Project Gutenberg*'s Top 100 eBooks page [https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top). This page lists the top 100 eBooks on *Project Gutenberg* and we can use `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the titles.

First, we're going to save the page as an HTML file. You can do this by right clicking on the page and selecting "Save As" and then saving it as `top_100_ebooks.html` in the same directory as your `first_web_scraping.py` file.

![](../../assets/images/save_top_100_ebooks.png)

Now we can try scraping the page!

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(open("top_100_ebooks.html"), features="html.parser")

print(soup.prettify())
```

You can see we now have the full html page in all it's weirdly organized HTML glory!

While it's great to be able to just see the HTML, usually we are scraping to structured HTML data and turn it into a structured data format like a CSV or JSON file. So let's try and get the titles of the top 100 eBooks.

First, let's take a look at the structure of the HTML document. We can use the inspect feature in your browser to do this. 

![](../../assets/images/inspect_top_100_ebooks_h2.png)

If we click the small arrow icon in our inspector, we can start to select relevant HTML elements. We can see that the `Top 100 EBooks yesterday` is an `h2` tag. After our readings about bestsellers and top of TikTok, we can imagine that scraping this list of books might be useful to researchers interested in what people are reading on *Project Gutenberg*.

![](../../assets/images/inspect_top_100_ebooks_p.png)

If we select the titles, we can see that they are nested in an `ol` tag and then each title is in a `li` tag. So we can use the `find_all()` method to get all the `li` tags in the document and then use the `get_text()` method to get the text of each `li` tag.

```python
titles = soup.find_all('li')
for title in titles:
	print(title.get_text())
```

However, you'll notice if we are running this code that we will get **all** the links on the page, not just the titles. This is because the `find_all()` method is searching the whole document and not just the `ol` tag. So we need to be more specific in our search.

#### Quick In-Class Exercise

In your `first_web_scraping.py` file, try to modify the code so that it only prints the titles of the `Top 100 EBooks yesterday` section. To do this, you'll need to access the correct tag for `Top 100 EBooks yesterday` and then use `BeautifulSoup` to navigate to the correct `ol` tag. Finally, we want to print just the title of each book. To help you I would recommend taking a look at the following functions in the `BeautifulSoup` documentation:

- `find_next()` [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#find-all-next-and-find-next](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#find-all-next-and-find-next)
- `get_text()` [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#get-text](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#get-text)

However, you are welcome to solve this problem in any way you want!

### Requesting and Scraping Web Pages

We are now officially scraping a web page 🥳!! But what if we wanted to scrape more than one? Saving each manually would get tiring really quickly!

Let's try taking our updated code but rather than working with the saved version of the web page, let's try to get the web page programmatically. To do this, we need to use the `requests` library to get the web page. We already installed requests initially so now we need to import it into our `first_web_scraping.py` file.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```

Let's also take a look at the documentation for the `requests` library [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

![](../../assets/images/requests_documentation.png)

You'll notice the tag line for the library is "HTTP for Humans" which is a great way to think about it. The `requests` library is a library that allows us to send HTTP requests to web pages as if we were a web browser. As you remember from our [lesson on the web](../introducing-humanities-computing/08-intro-web), when you go to a URL in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server and the server sends back an HTTP response. The `requests` library allows us to do the same thing in Python.

If we go to the `Quickstart` page [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart/](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart/), we can see how we not only import the library but also how we can use it.

For example, the core method in the `requests` library is the `get()` method, which is used to get a web page. The `get()` method returns a `Response` object, which has a `status_code` attribute that contains the status code of the request and a `headers` attribute that contains the headers of the request. Let's try it with our `Project Gutenberg` page.

```python
response = requests.get("https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top")
print("Status code:", response.status_code)
print("Headers:",response.headers)
```

We should see the following output:

```bash
Status code: 200
Header: {'date': 'Wed, 06 Oct 2021 17:00:01 GMT', 'server': 'Apache', 'content-location': 'top.php', 'vary': 'negotiate,Accept-Encoding', 'tcn': 'choice', 'content-encoding': 'gzip', 'content-length': '11521', 'x-backend': 'gutenweb5', 'content-type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'}
```

The `status_code` attribute contains the status code of the request and the `headers` attribute contains the headers of the request. The status code `200` means that the request was successful and the headers contain information about the request. If you don't get a `200` you can refresh your knowledge of the [other status codes in our lesson on the web](../introducing-humanities-computing/08-intro-web#what-is-http) but it usually means that either:

- you don't have access to the web page (so a status code of `403` or `404`)
- that there's an error on the server (so a status code of `500`)
- that the page doesn't exist (so a status code of `404`)
- Or there's an error with your internet connection.

Now that we have the `Response` object, we can use the `text` attribute to get the HTML of the page. Let's try it out.

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
print(soup.prettify())
```

We should see the HTML of the same page we downloaded printed out. This is great because it means we can now scrape any web page we want, not just the ones we have saved locally.

So returning to our previous our code, we can now use the `requests` library to get the web page and the `text` attribute of the `Response` object to get the HTML of the page.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
top_100_ebooks = soup.find(id="books-last1")
list_of_books = top_100_ebooks.find_next('ol').find_all('li')
for book in list_of_books:
	print(book.get_text())
```

Now that our code is working, we can start to consider what data we would actually want and how to structure it.

So far, we are only getting the `Top 100 EBooks Yesterday` but there's a number of top lists that we could scrape, including authors. So we could expand our code to get all top lists from this page and then store it in some sort of data structure, like a list of dictionaries.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
top_lists = soup.find_all("h2")

data = []
for top_list in top_lists:
	top_list_name = top_list.get_text()
	top_list_items = top_list.find_next('ol').find_all('li')
	for item in top_list_items:
		data.append({"list": top_list_name, "title": item.get_text()})
```

Now since we are getting both books and authors, let's create two separate lists of dictionaries, one for books and one for authors.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
top_lists = soup.find_all("h2")

books = []
authors = []

for top_list in top_lists:
	top_list_name = top_list.get_text()
	top_list_items = top_list.find_next('ol').find_all('li')
	for item in top_list_items:
		if "EBooks" in top_list_name:
			books.append({"list": top_list_name, "title": item.get_text()})
		else:
			authors.append({"list": top_list_name, "author": item.get_text()})
```

Finally, so far we are just saving the names of items but we could also save the links to the items. We could do this by getting the `href` attribute of the `a` tag.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
top_lists = soup.find_all("h2")

books = []
authors = []

for top_list in top_lists:
	top_list_name = top_list.get_text()
	top_list_items = top_list.find_next('ol').find_all('li')
	for item in top_list_items:
		if "EBooks" in top_list_name:
			books.append({"top_list": top_list_name, "book_title": item.get_text(), "book_link": item.find('a').get('href')})
		else:
			authors.append({"top_list": top_list_name, "author_name": item.get_text(), "author_link": item.find('a').get('href')})
```

Now we just need to save the data to a file. We could either create text files, but in this case it might be easier to create a csv file. To do that we would need to use the `csv` library, which is part of the Python Standard Library. We would also need to use the `open()` method to open a file and the `write()` method to write to the file. We would also need to use the `writerow()` method to write a row to the file.

```python
import csv

with open('top_100_ebooks.csv', 'w') as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	# Write the headers
	writer.writerow(['top_list', 'book_title', 'book_link'])
	for book in books:
		writer.writerow([book['top_list'], book['book_title'], book['book_link']])

with open('top_100_authors.csv', 'w') as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	# Write the headers
	writer.writerow(['top_list', 'author_name', 'author_link'])
	for author in authors:
		writer.writerow([author['top_list'], author['author_name'], author['author_link']])
```

You'll notice that I am using the `with` statement to open the file. This is a context manager that automatically closes the file when the block of code is done. This is a good practice because it ensures that the file is closed properly and that there are no issues with the file. Furthermore, I'm making the column headers the first row of the csv file and using lowercase and underscores in the names. This is a good practice because it makes it easier to read the file later on and to work with the data.

Now that we have links to other pages, we could also start using requests to get those pages and scrape them. Let's create a function to check if the web page exists and if we would be able to scrape it based on the status code.

```python
def check_page_exists(url):
	response = requests.get(url)
	if response.status_code == 200:
		return True
	else:
		return False
```

Now we can use this function to check if we can scrape the links to the books and authors.

```python
for book in books:
	book['webpage_exists'] = check_page_exists(book['book_link'])

for author in authors:
	author['webpage_exists'] = check_page_exists(author['author_link'])
```

You'll likely notice that we get a lot of errors when we run this code. Why is that?

Take a look at our links. You'll notice that the top book, *Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus* has a link of `/ebooks/84`. This is a relative link, which means that it's a link that is relative to the current page. This is different from an absolute link, which is a link that is absolute to the root of the website. So we need to convert the relative links to absolute links.

We can simply click on the link in the web page to see what the full URL is. In this case, the full URL is `https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84`. So we can use this information to convert the relative links to absolute links.

```python
def check_gutenberg_page_exists(url):
	gutenberg_url = "https://www.gutenberg.org" + url
	response = requests.get(gutenberg_url)
	if response.status_code == 200:
		return True
	else:
		return False
```

Now when we rerun our code, we should see that we are able to get the status code for each of the links! 

Many web pages use relative links, so this is a common issue when scraping web pages and it's why it's important to always inspect and explore the HTML of the web page you are scraping.

### Advanced Web Scraping

So far we have been scraping web pages that are relatively simple, but what if we wanted to scrape a more complex web page? For example, what if we wanted to scrape a fandom wiki page? These pages are often more complex because they have more complex HTML and CSS. Let's try scraping the *Lord of the Rings* wiki page [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).


For those unfamiliar, fandom wikis are fan-created wikis that are often used to document popular culture. I haven't been able to find a list of all of these wikis, but there is a wikipedia page listing some of the most prominent ones [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fan_wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fan_wikis). You'll notice that many of these wikis started in the mid-2000s and have grown in popularity since then. For example, there's actually a wikipedia page for the *Star Wars* wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookieepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookieepedia), which is called *Wookieepedia*.

![](../../assets/images/wikipedia_wookiepedia.png)

This page details some of the history and statistics of *Wookieepedia*, which started in 2005. You'll notice that it has over 150,000 articles and over 1,000,000 pages. This is a huge amount of information and according to the graph below, this wiki is far larger than the *Lord of the Rings* wiki.

![](https://i.redd.it/kiq4e7hmkeeb1.png)

Before we start scraping this fandom wiki though, we need to check for the terms of service or user policies of the website. So far I've only been able to find the following page on the wiki [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/LOTR:Current_policies](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/LOTR:Current_policies) which details the current policies of the wiki and that most of the content is under a `CC-BY-SA` license. There is a terms of service for Fandom wikis [https://www.fandom.com/terms-of-use](https://www.fandom.com/terms-of-use) but that also doesn't have clear information about scraping. So the final place we can check is the `robots.txt` file.

We can access this by going to the root of the website and adding `/robots.txt` to the end of the URL. For example, the `robots.txt` file for the *Lord of the Rings* wiki is [https://lotr.fandom.com/robots.txt](https://lotr.fandom.com/robots.txt). This file contains the rules for web crawlers and scrapers and tells them what they can and can't scrape. 

![](../../assets/images/lotr_robots_txt.png)

I won't post the full file here since it's quite long, but we can work through the main relevant sections:

1. The `User-agent` section tells us what web crawlers and scrapers are allowed to scrape the website. For example, the `User-agent: *` section tells us that all web crawlers and scrapers are allowed to scrape the website. This is the most common section and means that the website is open to scraping. 
2. Within the `User-agent` section, we can see there is a `Disallow` section tells us what web crawlers and scrapers are not allowed to scrape the website. For example, the `Disallow: /wiki/Special:` section tells us that web crawlers and scrapers are not allowed to scrape the `Special:` pages on the website. You'll also notice that some bots are explicitly disallowed from scraping the website, like SemrushBot or GPTBot.
3. Similarly, the `Allow` section tells us what web crawlers and scrapers are allowed to scrape the website. For example, the `Allow: /wiki/*` section tells us that web crawlers and scrapers are allowed to scrape the `wiki` pages on the website. We can also see the `Allow: /api.php?`, which allows crawlers to access certain API endpoints, which are often set up for structured data access, making them a good option for ethical scraping. This section is less common than the `Disallow` section but is used to allow web crawlers and scrapers to scrape certain pages on the website.
4. The `Noindex` section tells us what web crawlers and scrapers are not allowed to index. For example, the `Noindex: /wiki/Special:` section tells us that web crawlers and scrapers are not allowed to index the `Special:` pages on the website. Although this doesn’t restrict access, it signals pages that the site prefers to keep less visible. Scraping these pages could go against the site’s intentions for privacy or low visibility.
5. Finally, the `Sitemap` section tells us where the sitemap for the website is. For example, the `Sitemap: https://lotr.fandom.com/sitemap-newsitemapxml-index.xml` section tells us that the sitemap for the website is at `https://lotr.fandom.com/sitemap-newsitemapxml-index.xml`. This is less common than the other sections but is used to help web crawlers and scrapers find the sitemap for the website.

One additional item you might see is a `Crawl-delay` section tells us how long web crawlers and scrapers should wait between requests. For example, if a `robots.txt` says `Crawl-delay: 5` that tells us that web crawlers and scrapers should wait 5 seconds between requests. However, in our case the `robots.txt` file for the *Lord of the Rings* wiki doesn't have this section.

Looking through this `robots.txt` tells us that we can scrape many of the pages on the *Lord of the Rings* wiki, but we should be careful to avoid the `Special:` pages and to respect the `Noindex` sections. This is a good practice to follow when scraping websites and it's always a good idea to check the `robots.txt` file before scraping a website.

So let's try scraping the *Lord of the Rings* wiki page. We can start by getting the web page using the `requests` library and then using the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML.

```python
response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page")
print(response.status_code)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```

If you are getting an error, you might need to add the `timeout` parameter to the `get()` method. This parameter tells the `requests` library how long to wait for a response before timing out. For example, if you wanted to wait 5 seconds for a response, you would add `timeout=5` to the `get()` method.

```python
response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page", timeout=5)
```

You can also do a speed test like we read about in "The Website Obesity Crisis" article to see how long it takes to get a response from the website.

```python
import time

start = time.time()
response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page")
end = time.time()
print(end - start)
```

Now since this wiki is huge, we need to narrow our focus to a particular goal or question. While there are literally thousands of pages on this wiki, we could start by scraping the character pages. In particular, there's been a new adaption of *The Lord of the Rings* by Amazon called *Rings of Power*, so we could start by scraping the character pages for the characters in the new adaption.

![](../../assets/images/rings_of_power.png)

We can see there are two pages for characters: one for canon (that is existing) characters in the show and one for new characters. We could start by scraping the canon characters page [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power).

First, we need to inspect the HTML of the page to see how the characters are structured. 

![](../../assets/images/inspect_rings_of_power.png)

We can see that while each character is listed in a larger div with the class `category-page__member`, the character name is in a `a` tag with the class `category-page__member-link`. So we can use the `find_all()` method to get all the `a` tags with the class `category-page__member-link` and then use the `get_text()` method to get the text of each `a` tag.

```python
response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
characters = soup.find_all('a', class_='category-page__member-link')

for character in characters:
	print(character.get_text())
```

Now if we click on one of these character pages like [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Galadriel](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Galadriel), we can see that there's a lot of information about the character. We could try scraping this page as well. For now, let's focus on seeing how many languages each character page has been translated into. We can see this at the top of the character page.

![](../../assets/images/inspect_galadriel.png)

We can see that the first translation is into `Catallà`, which is Catalan, which has a link with the attribute `data-tracking-label="lang-ca"`. We can use this structure to get the number of languages each character page has been translated into. To do this, we need to use something called `regex` or regular expressions. `regex` is a way to search for patterns in text and is a powerful tool for text processing. We can use the `re` library, which is part of the Python Standard Library, to use `regex`.

```python
import re

response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Galadriel")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
languages = soup.find_all('a', attrs={'data-tracking-label': re.compile(r'lang-')})
for language in languages:
	print(language.get('data-tracking-label'))
	print(language.get_text())
```

Now that we have the number of languages each character page has been translated into, we can start to think about how to structure this data and how to turn some of our logic into a function. We could create a list of dictionaries with the character name and the number of languages the character page has been translated into.

```python
def get_character_languages(url):
	response = requests.get(url)
	soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
	languages = soup.find_all('a', attrs={'data-tracking-label': re.compile(r'lang-')})
	return [{"language": language.get('data-tracking-label'), "language_name": language.get_text()} for language in languages]

response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power")

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
canon_characters = soup.find_all('a', class_='category-page__member-link')

canon_characters_data = []

for character in canon_characters:
	character_data = {"character": character.get_text(), "character_link": character.get('href')}
	character_data['languages'] = get_character_languages("https://lotr.fandom.com" + character_data['character_link'])
	character_data['langauges_count'] = len(character_data['languages'])
	canon_characters_data.append(character_data)

with open('lotr_canon_characters.csv', 'w') as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	writer.writerow(['character', 'character_link', 'languages', 'languages_count'])
	for character in canon_characters_data:
		writer.writerow([character['character'], character['character_link'], character['languages'], character['langauges_count']])
```

Now we could do the same for the new characters page [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:New_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:New_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power) and then compare the number of languages the canon characters have been translated into with the number of languages the new characters have been translated into. We could also use the `Rich` library from the last assignment to print out the data in a more readable format.

```python
response = requests.get("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters_created_for_The_Rings_of_Power")

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
new_characters = soup.find_all('a', class_='category-page__member-link')

new_characters_data = []

for character in new_characters:
	character_data = {"character": character.get_text(), "character_link": character.get('href')}
	character_data['languages'] = get_character_languages("https://lotr.fandom.com" + character_data['character_link'])
	character_data['langauges_count'] = len(character_data['languages'])
	new_characters_data.append(character_data)

with open('lotr_new_characters.csv', 'w') as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	writer.writerow(['character', 'character_link', 'languages', 'languages_count'])
	for character in new_characters_data:
		writer.writerow([character['character'], character['character_link'], character['languages'], character['langauges_count'])

from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

console = Console()

table = Table(title="Translations of LOTR Canon Characters VS New Characters")
table.add_column("Character", style="cyan")
table.add_column("Language Count", style="magenta")

for character in canon_characters_data:
	table.add_row(character['character'], str(character['langauges_count']))

for character in new_characters_data:
	table.add_row(character['character'], str(character['langauges_count']))

console.print(table)
```

We could even rewrite this code to be more DRY (that is the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself) by creating a function to get the character data and then using that function to get the canon and new character data.

```python
import re
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

console = Console()

def get_character_languages(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    languages = soup.find_all('a', attrs={'data-tracking-label': re.compile(r'lang-')})
    return [{"language": language.get('data-tracking-label'), "language_name": language.get_text()} for language in languages]

def fetch_characters(url, category):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    characters = soup.find_all('a', class_='category-page__member-link')
    characters_data = []

    for character in characters:
        console.print(f"Processing {character.get_text()}...")
        character_data = {
            "character": character.get_text(),
            "character_link": character.get('href'),
            "category": category
        }
        character_data['languages'] = get_character_languages("https://lotr.fandom.com" + character_data['character_link'])
        character_data['languages_count'] = len(character_data['languages'])
        characters_data.append(character_data)
    
    return characters_data

# Fetch characters from the given URLs
canon_characters_data = fetch_characters("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Canon_characters_in_The_Rings_of_Power", "Canon")
new_characters_data = fetch_characters("https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters_created_for_The_Rings_of_Power", "New")

# Combine and sort characters by language count
all_characters_data = canon_characters_data + new_characters_data
sorted_characters = sorted(all_characters_data, key=lambda x: x['languages_count'], reverse=True)

# Display the sorted characters in a table
table = Table(title="Translations of LOTR Canon Characters VS New Characters")
table.add_column("Character", style="cyan")
table.add_column("Language Count", style="magenta")
table.add_column("Category", style="green")

for character in sorted_characters:
    table.add_row(character['character'], str(character['languages_count']), character['category'])

console.print(table)
```

![](../../assets/images/lotr_characters_table.png)

Now in our full script we import all the libraries at the top, have two functions that get the character data and then fetch the characters, and then we combine and sort the characters by language count. We then display the sorted characters in a table using the `Rich` library. This is a much cleaner and more readable script that is easier to understand and work with.

While we have seen how we can use `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` for web scraping, there are other Python libraries like `Selenium` [https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and `Scrapy` [https://scrapy.org/](https://scrapy.org/) that can be used for web scraping.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709360753547/5a8f9a15-4d18-4802-89d0-007b120068cb.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)

There are pros and cons to each library, but I mention them because if you are trying to scrape a more complex website that uses dynamic Javascript to render web pages, you might need to use either `Selenium` or `Scrapy`. `Selenium` is a library that allows you to control a web browser programmatically and can be used to scrape websites that use dynamic Javascript. `Scrapy` is a library that is specifically designed for web scraping and is a more advanced library that can be used to scrape websites at scale. As we've learned lots of websites are quite bloated, so it's always good to be aware of these other libraries.

## Fandom Wikis and Web Scraping Homework

Now that you have learned the basics of web scraping, it's time to try it out for your next homework assignment. In your `is310-coding-assignments`, you should have already create a new directory called `web_scraping_assignments` and a new file called `first_web_scraping.py`. You should now create a new file called `fandom_wiki_scraping.py` in the `web_scraping_assignments` directory.

In this assignment, you are welcome to select **any** fandom wiki you are interested in and the goal is try scraping the wiki. You should complete the following tasks:

- [ ] Check the terms of service or user policies of the website. Ensure that you are allowed to scrape the website in the `robots.txt` file and include a link to the file in your `README.md` for the assignment.
- [ ] Explain your choice of fandom wiki and what you are interested in scraping from the wiki in your `README.md` for the assignment. **You should explain why you think the data you are scraping might be of interest or useful to researchers.**
- [ ] Use the `requests` library to get the web page and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML of the web page, and include this code in your `fandom_wiki_scraping.py` file.
- [ ] Include the data you are scraping in an interoperable file format like a CSV or JSON file and include this data in your `web_scraping_assignments` directory.

Once you have completed the assignment, you should **post a link to your folder** in our GitHub discussion [https://github.com/CultureAsData-UIUC/is310-fall-2024/discussions/9](https://github.com/CultureAsData-UIUC/is310-fall-2024/discussions/9).

## Overview

Your performance in weekly assessments constitutes **half of your final grade**.

These assessments include:

- In-class discussions
- Asynchronous annotations
- Weekly coding assignments

. . .

**Graded as pass/fail** — but engagement, creativity, and growth matter!

---

## Weekly Participation (25%)

Two components:

1. **Individual engagement** with course materials
2. **Collaborative group presentations**

Both ensure you're deepening your own understanding AND learning from peers.

---

## Seminar Discussion & Annotations (15%)

Before each class, engage with assigned materials:

- Book chapters or articles
- Data visualizations
- Documentation

These lay the groundwork for class discussions and your semester project.

---

## Questions to Consider

When engaging with weekly materials, ask yourself:

- What is the main argument? Is there one?
- How does the author support their argument?
- What evidence or data did they use?
- What is the likely audience?

---

## More Questions to Consider

- What connections or tensions exist across materials?
- What was confusing or unclear?
- How does this connect to previous weeks?

. . .

**Goal:** Summarize central points in a few lines, not detail everything!

---

## Demonstrating Engagement

### Option 1: Seminar Discussions

- Ask questions about complex concepts
- Share connections across materials
- Respond thoughtfully to peers

. . .

**Goal:** Create a thoughtful and respectful intellectual community

---

## Demonstrating Engagement

### Option 2: Asynchronous Annotations

Using **Hypothesis** annotation platform:

- Share thoughts on weekly materials
- Engage with peers' annotations
- May be asked to expand during discussions

## Group Presentations (10%)

Groups assigned in first two weeks based on:

- Student interests
- Backgrounds (music, literature, social media, gaming, etc.)

---

## Group Work Structure

**Weekly Prompts and Activities:**

- Find digital objects
- Explore datasets
- Apply concepts from readings

---

## In-Class Presentations

- Not every group presents every week
- Even if not presenting:
  - Submit work to GitHub
  - Be prepared to discuss

. . .

Presentations should be **clear, concise**, and demonstrate understanding.

---

## Documentation Requirements

All group work must be documented on GitHub:

- Summary of activities
- How labor was divided
- Reflections on the process

. . .

**Clear documentation is crucial** for grading and project progress!

---

## Grading: Group Work

Based on:

- Active participation in presentations
- Quality of contributions
- Effectiveness of collaboration

. . .

Grade not impacted if a member is absent (but group must pivot).

---

## Group Work Deadlines

- **Late submissions:** Half credit (with explanation)
- **Repeated late submissions:** Meeting with Instructor

---

## Weekly Coding Assignments (25%)

- Complete and share via GitHub
- **Pair programming encouraged!**

. . .

Work together, but make sure you **understand the concepts** — they build quickly!

---

## Grading: Coding Assignments

- Due: **Midnight before class**
